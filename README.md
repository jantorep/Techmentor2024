# Techmentor2024

This is the repository for my Session slides at Techmentor August 2024 at Microsoft HQ

In this repo there is a copy of the Azure Landing Zone Bicep Repo with configuration. Due to path and file name lenghts the code files and structure is on the root path.

All slides are under the Slides folder.

The code for the AVD Session is under the folder named Building a Secure and Non-Secure AVD Platform on Azure Stack HCI 23h2

And i also added what is called subscription vending. It is something you will need to look at to figure out how to work. There are code examples there. But find it ont he official Subscription Vending github page.

Thanks
